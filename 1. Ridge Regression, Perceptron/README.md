### <ins>Ridge Regression:</ins>
Here, you will code a Matlab (or Octave) function that implements the Least Square (LS) algorithm seen in class and a generalization called Regularized Least Squares (RLS), or Ridge Regression. We will apply RLS to a real-world 8-dimensional (8 features) prostate cancer dataset contained in the file prostateStnd.mat. In this dataset, 8 medically relevant features named lcavol, lweight, age, lbph, svi, lcp, gleason, and pgg45 are used to estimate lpsa (log prostate specific antigen). The training and test data are provided as (xtrain, ytrain) and (xtest, ytest) respectively. The first 8 features correspond to the first 8 entries of names. The ninth entry of names (the last one) is the label to be predicted whose values are in (ytest, ytrain).
